        <h2>We made this just for us.</h2>
        <p>We wanted a quick alternative to texting our partners “Where are you?” that would be persist for a while and wasn’t a total piece of shit like the current alternatives.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        <h2>You need Facebook to use it.</h2>
        <p>We didn’t want to be burdened with creating an unwielding friend-searching system. If you’re friends on Facebook and both use pushmeetup, you can ask each other for your location.
          <br>If you do not have a Facebook account, don’t download our app.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        <h2>Future plans</h2>
        <p>Pushmeetup will be supported for the coming iOS versions, until something better replaces our app. We will solve bugs, but not add new features. It does what it needs to do.
        <br><br>
We won’t be releasing an Android app, unless someone sponsors us. We’re working on something <i>much</i> cooler now.</p>
